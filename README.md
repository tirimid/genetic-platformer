# genetic-platformer

## Introduction

Genetic Platformer is a very simple game. You build basic platformer courses
(utilizing mechanics such as killing blocks, coins, end goals, and spawnpoints)
for AI players to complete. They will learn how to complete the course through
trial and error using a genetic algorithm. Hence, Genetic Platformer.

## Dependencies

* Firefox (to run the extension)

## Management

* Go to `about:debugging` and add this extension as a temporary plugin

## Usage

Once the extension is added, you can open it like any other. It will create a
popup with the game contents. It functions as a page, so closing this popup will
just terminate the game and reset everything.

## Contributing

Don't bother contributing. I threw this together in 2 days just as a sort of
experiment with Firefox extensions and the genetic algorithm. You may fork the
repository and create your own version.
